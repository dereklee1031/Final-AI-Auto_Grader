## What It Does

GradeAI Pro is an end-to-end automated grading system that:

- **Reads student submissions** — PDF, PowerPoint, and Excel files including images and diagrams
- **Understands lecture content** — stores your lecture materials in a vector database (RAG)
- **Retrieves relevant context** — fetches matching lecture sections before grading each student
- **Grades against a rubric** — uses GPT-4o-mini / Gemini / Claude to evaluate each criterion
- **Generates PDF reports** — per-student grade breakdown with evidence and feedback
- **Exports to CSV** — all grades in one spreadsheet for your gradebook

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following are installed on your machine:

| Requirement | Version | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.10 or newer | https://www.python.org/downloads/ |
| Git | any | https://git-scm.com/ |
| Tesseract OCR | 5.x | See below |
| At least one API key | — | OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic |

### Install Tesseract OCR

Tesseract is needed for reading scanned/image-based PDFs.

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

**Windows:**
Download the installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki 
Then add Tesseract to your PATH.

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chava-Sai/Final-AI-Auto_Grader.git
cd Final-AI-Auto_Grader

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate it
#    macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
#    Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The first install may take 2–3 minutes — ChromaDB and sentence-transformers are large packages.

---

## Configuration — API Keys

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open `.env` in any text editor and fill in your keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # from platform.openai.com
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...       # from aistudio.google.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # from console.anthropic.com
```

You only need **one** key to start grading. The app lets you pick the provider in the UI.

### Which embedding provider to choose?

Set `CHROMA_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` in your `.env`:

| Value | What it uses | Cost | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google` | gemini-embedding-001 | ~free tier | Best quality (recommended) |
| `openai` | text-embedding-3-small | ~$0.00002/chunk | Good quality |
| *(empty)* | local all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Free, no key | Offline / no cost |

> ⚠️ **Security:** `.env` is already in `.gitignore`. Never commit it to GitHub.

---

## Running the Web App

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Start the server
python scripts/web/app.py
```

Then open your browser at: **http://localhost:5000**

You should see the GradeAI Pro interface with three tabs:
- **Grade Submissions** — upload and grade student work
- **Manage Lectures** — upload and index lecture materials
- **Rubric & Setup** — manage assignments, rubrics, and quizzes

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

This is the exact workflow for a professor using the system each semester.

---

### Step 1 — Upload & Describe Lectures

> Do this **once per semester** when you upload new lecture materials.

1. Go to the **Manage Lectures** tab
2. Click **Upload Lecture PDF** and upload your lecture PDFs (one at a time)
3. After uploading, click **Describe Lecture**
 - Select a Vision AI provider (OpenAI or Gemini recommended)
 - This reads every image and diagram in the PDF — takes 1–3 minutes per lecture
4. Repeat for all lecture modules

**What this does:** The system extracts text, tables, and images from each PDF, then uses Vision AI to describe every diagram and figure. This creates rich, searchable content.

---

### Step 2 — Push Lectures to RAG

> Do this **once** after describing all lectures.

1. Still on the **Manage Lectures** tab
2. Click **Index All Lectures into RAG**
 - This embeds all described lecture content into ChromaDB
 - Takes 1–5 minutes depending on how many lectures you have
3. You'll see a confirmation: *"Shared Chroma index is ready"*

**What this does:** All lecture chunks are embedded into a vector database. When grading, the system automatically retrieves the most relevant lecture sections for each student's work.

---

### Step 3 — Upload Assignment & Rubric

> Do this **once per assignment**.

1. Go to the **Rubric & Setup** tab
2. Under **Assignments**, click **Upload** and add your assignment PDF
 - Use the PDF version of the assignment (not a plain text file) for best results
3. Under **Rubrics**, click **Upload** and add your rubric
 - Supported formats: `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.json`
 - **Tip:** A DOCX rubric with a table (criterion | points | checklist items) gives the best grading results
4. Alternatively, click **Generate Rubric from Assignment** to have AI create a rubric from your assignment text

---

### Step 4 — Grade Student Submissions

1. Go to the **Grade Submissions** tab
2. Under **Files**, click **Add Files** and select student submissions
 - Supported: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`
 - You can select multiple students at once for batch grading
3. Choose your settings:
 - **Grading Provider:** OpenAI (fast/cheap), Gemini, or Anthropic (most thorough)
 - **Assignment:** select the assignment you uploaded in Step 3
 - **Rubric:** select the rubric you uploaded in Step 3
4. Click **Grade**
5. Watch the progress log — grading takes about 1–3 minutes per student

**What happens behind the scenes:**
```
Upload → Extract text/images → Vision AI describes diagrams
  → Retrieve matching lecture context from RAG
    → LLM grades each rubric criterion
      → Apply policy caps → Generate PDF report
```

---

### Step 5 — View Reports & Export

1. After grading completes, click **View Report** next to any student to see their detailed PDF
2. Go to the **Reports** section to see all grading history
3. Click **Export CSV** to download all grades in a spreadsheet

Each PDF report includes:
- Overall score and total points
- Per-criterion scores with checklist evaluation
- Evidence quotes from the student's submission
- Any policy caps that were applied (e.g., missing diagram)

## Architecture Overview

The full system design — including all 4 pipeline stages, API endpoints, and data flow — is shown below:

![GradeAI Pro System Architecture](docs/GradeAI_Pro_Architecture.svg)

> **Four pipeline stages:**
> 1. **Lecture Knowledge Base** — HTML/PDF lecture ingestion → Vision AI diagram descriptions → Deduplication → Google Embeddings → ChromaDB (4,185 chunks)
> 2. **Rubric Generation** — Assignment instructions → `claude-sonnet-4-6` → JSON rubric with criteria + checklist (Generate or Enhance mode)
> 3. **Grading Pipeline** — Student PPTX/PDF/XLSX → Document Extractor + Vision AI → RAG Retrieval (top-8) → **LLM grader (few-shot calibration in `SYSTEM_PROMPT`)** → YES/PARTIAL/NO → grade-band mapping → policy caps where needed → PDF Report + CSV
> 4. **Quiz Batch Grading** — Excel upload → Column detection → Per-cell LLM → Scored Excel output. **Quiz-specific few-shot calibration** (see below) is stored as editable text and used to align short-answer quiz items with human scores.

### Few-shot calibration — quizzes (Quiz 1, Question 13)

Some quiz items are graded with a **dedicated** system prompt that includes the official sub-rubric, error-correction rules, and **ANCHOR EXAMPLES** (graded exemplar answers) so the model does not over-rely on keyword matching. For CS 581 Quiz 1, Question 13 (BPR for EHR), the prompt is versioned in:

- `scripts/grading/calibrations/quiz1_q13_bpr_system_prompt.txt`
- `scripts/grading/regrade_quiz1_with_new_prompt.py` — batch re-grading / calibration runs against an anonymized **AI vs human** spreadsheet. Pass the path to your `.xlsx` and optional column indices; no machine-specific paths are required.

```bash
python scripts/grading/regrade_quiz1_with_new_prompt.py path/to/CS581_Quiz1_AI_vs_Human_Anonymized.xlsx
```

### Few-shot calibration (this repo, `scripts/grading/grade_submission.py`)

There is **no** per-run fine-tuning. **Few-shot calibration** is implemented as **fixed, in-prompt** instructions on every grading call:

- **Blind grading** — The grader is told to ignore path/folder cues (for example, “good example” or “bad example”) and to score only the submission against the rubric and assignment.
- **CALIBRATION GUIDE** — The system prompt includes anchor scenarios so the model’s `checklist_pct` tracks coverage consistently, for example: all ☐ items covered well → about 92–95%; ~80% strong + rest partial → about 88–90%; about half the items → about 65–70%; do not over-penalize phrasing, style, or substituting a structured table for a swim-lane diagram when the rubric allows it.
- **Graduate standard + YES/PARTIAL/NO rules** — Encourages substance over exact wording, bias toward PARTIAL over NO when there is any attempt, and ties checklist completion to a concrete `checklist_pct` formula: `(yes + 0.67 × partial) / total × 100`.
- **Grade band table in the same prompt** — The LLM must map `checklist_pct` to *awarded points* using the stepwise multiplier bands below (the table in code is the source of truth; Python can still re-snap or cap outputs for consistency and policy).

Optional rubric and assignment text are merged into the same request so the model knows what “done” means for that assignment.

**Additional few-shot file (lowers grader–human error):** You can append instructor-written exemplars via `--few-shot-file path/to/exemplars.txt` on `grade_submission` / `run_pipeline --mode grade`, or set `AUTO_GRADER_FEW_SHOT_FILE` in `.env` (used by the web app’s grading subprocess). Content is added to the **system** prompt under `=== FEW-SHOT EXEMPLARS (calibration) ===` (capped at 16k chars). `grades.json` records `few_shot_file` when loaded.

### Grading Logic

The grading engine (`scripts/grading/grade_submission.py`) works as follows:

1. **Parse rubric** — extracts criteria, max points, and checklist items
2. **Evaluate checklist** — each item rated YES / PARTIAL / NO
3. **Calculate percentage** — `(yes + 0.67×partial) / total × 100`
4. **Snap to grade band** — maps percentage to a multiplier (as defined in the grader’s system prompt):

| Checklist % | Multiplier (× max points) |
|---|---|
| 95–100% | 1.000 |
| 90–94% | 0.933 |
| 85–89% | 0.900 |
| 80–84% | 0.833 |
| 75–79% | 0.800 |
| 70–74% | 0.733 |
| 65–69% | 0.700 |
| 60–64% | 0.633 |
| 55–59% | 0.567 |
| 50–54% | 0.533 |
| below 50% | 0.500 |

5. **Apply policy caps** (deterministic post-processing in code when applicable) — for example, missing required workflow deliverable, section-coverage heuristics, and **no evidential match** for a criterion can cap the awarded points. See the implementation in `grade_submission.py` for exact conditions and thresholds.

## For Future Developers

> This section is for students who will continue this project in future semesters.

### Handoff Notes — Spring 2026

#### What Was Built

This project was developed during **Spring 2026** at Boston University MET (CS/CDS). The following components are fully implemented and working:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HTML + PDF lecture ingestion | ✅ Complete | BeautifulSoup + PyMuPDF, 142 HTML + 6 PDF modules |
| Vision AI diagram descriptions | ✅ Complete | OpenAI gpt-4o, Gemini, Claude with auto-tiling |
| ChromaDB RAG index | ✅ Complete | 4,185 chunks, L2≤1.5, Google/OpenAI/local embeddings |
| Rubric generation (AI) | ✅ Complete | claude-sonnet-4-6, Generate + Enhance modes |
| Student grading (PDF/PPTX/XLSX) | ✅ Complete | All 3 LLM providers, policy caps, grade bands |
| Quiz batch grading (Excel) | ✅ Complete | Fuzzy column detection, per-cell LLM, scored output |
| PDF grade reports | ✅ Complete | Per-criterion breakdown, evidence, policy cap log |
| CSV export | ✅ Complete | All grades in one spreadsheet |
| Flask web UI | ✅ Complete | 3-tab interface, batch grading, library management |

#### What Was NOT Built (Future Work)

- **No automated test suite** — unit tests for grading logic are the highest-priority gap
- **No authentication** — the web UI has no login; not suitable for public deployment without adding auth
- **No async job queue** — batch grading blocks the Flask worker; large batches (>10 students) may time out; consider Celery + Redis
- **No hosted deployment** — currently runs locally only; needs Gunicorn + Nginx or a cloud deployment for shared use
- **No plagiarism detection** — no cross-student comparison or similarity scoring
- **No grade appeal workflow** — grades are final; no UI for students to dispute

#### How to Start Efficiently (Next Team)

1. **Read this README end to end** — the full workflow is documented in [Step-by-Step Workflow](#step-by-step-workflow)
2. **Run the app locally first** — follow [Installation](#installation) and grade one sample student to see the full pipeline
3. **Read these two files** (the core of the system):
 - `scripts/grading/grade_submission.py` — rubric parsing, scoring, policy caps
 - `scripts/web/blueprints/grading.py` — how the UI triggers grading
4. **Check the dataset documentation** — see `dataset-documentation/DATASETDOC-sp26.md` for data provenance and structure
5. **Your first recommended tasks** (in order):
 - Add pytest tests for `grade_submission.py` (scoring math is critical to validate)
 - Add async job processing so batch grading doesn't block
 - Add a simple login page (Flask-Login) before any shared deployment

#### Where Key Data Lives

| Data | Location | Gitignored? |
|---|---|---|
| Lecture PDFs/HTMLs | `data/library/lectures/` | Yes |
| Student submissions | `data/library/assignments/` | Yes |
| Rubric files | `data/library/rubrics/` | Yes |
| ChromaDB vector index | `outputs/final_phase1/chroma_db/` | Yes |
| Grade PDF reports | `data/reports/` | Yes |
| Lecture chunks (JSONL) | `outputs/final_phase1/lecture_chunks_hybrid.jsonl` | Yes |
| API keys | `.env` | Yes — never commit |

All gitignored data directories are **auto-created** on first app startup.

### How to Add a New Grading Provider

1. Open `scripts/web/config.py`
2. Add an entry to the `PROVIDERS` dict:
   ```python
   "myprovider": {
       "label": "My Provider",
       "model": "my-model-name",
       "color": "#hex",
       "icon":  "myprovider",
   }
   ```
3. Add the API key env var to `PROVIDER_API_KEY_ENV`
4. In `scripts/grading/grade_submission.py`, extend the `_call_llm()` function to handle the new provider

### How to Add a New Document Format

1. Create `scripts/extractors/myformat_extractor.py` following the pattern in `pdf_extractor.py`
2. Export it from `scripts/extractors/__init__.py`
3. Add the file extension to `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` in `scripts/core/config.py`
4. Add the extension to `STUDENT_ALLOWED_EXTS` in `scripts/web/config.py`

### How the Web App Calls the Pipeline

The web app **never imports the grading code directly**. Instead, blueprints in `scripts/web/blueprints/` call `_run()` from `scripts/web/utils/pipeline.py`, which launches `scripts/cli/run_pipeline.py` as a **subprocess**. This keeps the web process clean and allows the pipeline to run independently.

### Key Files to Understand First

| File | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `scripts/cli/run_pipeline.py` | The central CLI — all 7 pipeline modes live here |
| `scripts/grading/grade_submission.py` | The grading engine — rubric parsing, scoring, policy caps |
| `scripts/web/config.py` | All paths and provider config — change defaults here |
| `scripts/retrieval/chroma_rag.py` | RAG indexing and retrieval |
| `scripts/web/blueprints/grading.py` | Web grading routes — how UI triggers the pipeline |
| `scripts/web/blueprints/lecture.py` | Lecture upload, describe, and RAG push flow |

### Running Tests

There is no automated test suite yet — this is a good first contribution for next semester students. Key areas to test:

- Rubric parsing (DOCX table, regex, AI fallback)
- Grade band snapping logic
- Policy cap application
- ChromaDB indexing and retrieval round-trip

### Recommended First Issues for Next Semester

- [ ] Add pytest unit tests for `grade_submission.py` scoring logic
- [ ] Add support for `.html` student submissions in the web UI
- [ ] Add a "re-grade with different model" button that preserves extraction
- [ ] Add email notification when batch grading completes
- [ ] Add a rubric quality checker (warns if rubric has no checklist items)
- [ ] Support multi-slide PPTX rubrics (currently only PDF/DOCX)

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error on startup
Make sure your virtual environment is active:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```
Then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Tesseract not found
Install Tesseract (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)) and make sure it's on your PATH:
```bash
tesseract --version   # should print version number
```

### Grading returns very low scores (below 40)
Check which assignment file is selected. A plain `.txt` file with strict rules will score much lower than the full assignment PDF. Always use the PDF version of the assignment.

### ChromaDB rate limit (429 error) when indexing
This happens with Google embeddings on large lecture sets. The system automatically batches with `--chroma-batch-size 20`. If it still fails, wait 60 seconds and retry.

### "Describe pipeline failed" in the web UI
This usually means a Vision API key is missing or the selected provider has no credits. Check your `.env` file and verify the key works at the provider's dashboard.

### Port 5000 already in use
```bash
FLASK_PORT=5001 python scripts/web/app.py
```
Or find and kill the process using port 5000:
```bash
lsof -i :5000          # macOS/Linux — find the PID
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Grades differ between runs
The LLM has slight non-determinism even at temperature=0. Small differences (±2 pts) are normal. Larger differences usually mean different assignment files were selected between runs.
